TODOS
-----

- should we have more output? All I see after the first build is:
    Compiled successfully in 1472ms 
    + 2 hidden modules
- need to add a GH issue template
- upgrade to latest webpack and test things

LATER
-----
- add logging and, for example, advertise what we're
    doing with the .babelrc file

- add some sort of init script? It would:
    - .gitignore /node_modules (maybe output path, guessed?)
    - it would create a sample webpack.config.js

- they add a note on top of the config files
    // Note: You must restart bin/webpack-dev-server for changes to take effect

- they make me think our loaders (buildRulesConfig) code could
    be cleaned up to be more readable!

- for react, they install prop-types
    - so, how can we encourage them to install *all*
        necessary deps


## LESS IMPORTANT
- should we think about how a user might, in theory, have a
     vendor entry (for caching) and also some sort of "common"
     entry that's included on every page? Should we really push
     that "commons" entry to be a vendor... not things with your
     code?
- create an example repository
- Check out sourcemap warning on this page
    https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/
      > Note about source maps support and assets...
- sourcemaps ARE dumped in SASS files... always :/
