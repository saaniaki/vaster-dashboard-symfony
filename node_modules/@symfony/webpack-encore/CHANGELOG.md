# CHANGELOG

## 0.9.1

 * Syntax error fix - #64

## 0.9.0

 * [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] When using `autoProvidejQuery()`, `window.jQuery` is now also
   included (and so will be re-written in the compiled files). If you're also exposing
   `jQuery` as a global variable, you'll need to update your code:

   ```js
   // Before: if you had this
   window.jQuery = require('jquery');

   // After: change to this
   global.jQuery = require('jquery');
   ```

  * Vue.js support! See #49

  * Typescript support! See #50

## 0.8.0

 * Windows support fixed #28

 * Added `Encore.addPlugin()` #19

 * Added `Encore.addLoader()` #11

 * `Encore.cleanupOutputBeforeBuild()` now empties the directory
   instead or removing it.
